 a.) for(i=1;i<=n;i++)
	for(j=i;i<=n;j++)
		printf("Hi");
	 
      According to given ques. the time complexity is "infinite" coz it gives a infinite loop.
		 		(or)
     In case if the condition statement in inner loop is "j<=n" instead of "i<=n",then  T.C = O(n^2).


b.) for(i=1;i<=n;i*=3)
	for(j=1;i<=n;j++)
		printf("Hello");

	According to given ques. the time complexity is "infinite" coz it gives a infinite loop.
		 		(or)
 	In case if the condition statement in inner loop is "j<=n" instead of "i<=n",then  T.C = O(n*(logn(base3))).
